# Convolutions
A rundown of the idea of convolutions and how they are used for image regcognition in a CNN  

# Convolution Basics
The idea of a convolution is a way to combine 2 functions into a 3rd new function where the results overlap as one is shifted over another  
  
Example of a convoltuion between (1,2,3) * (4,5,6)  
 $$(1*4) = 4$$  
 $$(1*5) + (2*4) = 13$$
 $$(1*6) + (2*5) + (3*4) = 28$$  
 $$(2*6) + (5*3) = 27$$  
 $$(3*6) = 18$$  
 $$(1,2,3) * (4,5,6) = (4,13,28,27,18)$$
